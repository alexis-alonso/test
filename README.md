Please create a Login UI that looks like the sample template photo below.
Please use HTML and CSS.
This Login Page DOES NOT need to be functional.
Please have your CSS in an external CSS file, and link that to your HTML file in the <head> section.

Please have a Draft Ready by 06/16/2022
You may create multiple drafts of a login page and submit them in your code repository.
You must Create an HTML and CSS project that meets the following requirements: 

The Login box must be centered in the screen and stay in the center of the screen even as you resize the web-browser window.
You must use flexbox.
This should be relatively easily acomplished with flexbox.
The login box should have a minimum size, and the input fields or text in the box should not leak out of the box.
The login box should have box-shadow and rounded edges.
The login box should have a username and password input field, with placeholder text like in the photo.
If you can, please make sure text entered into the password field is hidden (with asterisks or circles)
The login box should have a button.

You may experiment with colors if you would like, feel free to use the color palette generator.
You may experiment with additional features/styles, but if you do please make separate files for those experiments, thank you.
